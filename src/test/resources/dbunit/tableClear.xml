<!-- 

	 Used for debugging purposes only when the database has been "dirtied" by test data and dbunit cannot clear
	 xml datasets from the database / cannot cleanly insert into the database. This usually comes from setting the
	 defaultrollback to false thus allowing test data to be persisted. This file will allow dbunit to cleanly
	 insert because it knows about tables which have a "dirty state" and just cleanly insert nothing into them in
	 the database setup of the test (a @databaseSetup annotation should reference this xml file). 
	 All tables that are related to the test should be used here. 
	 
	 FYI the dirty test data which is left inside the database will always be there and cannot be removed by dbunit
	 because it just rolls back to that state.
